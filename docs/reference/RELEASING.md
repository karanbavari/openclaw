# Release Policy

OpenClaw has three public release lanes:

- stable: tagged releases that publish to npm `latest` and mirror the same version onto `beta` unless `beta` already points at a newer prerelease
- beta: prerelease tags that publish to npm `beta`
- dev: the moving head of `main`

## Version naming

- Stable release version: `YYYY.M.D`
  - Git tag: `vYYYY.M.D`
- Stable correction release version: `YYYY.M.D-N`
  - Git tag: `vYYYY.M.D-N`
- Beta prerelease version: `YYYY.M.D-beta.N`
  - Git tag: `vYYYY.M.D-beta.N`
- Do not zero-pad month or day
- `latest` means the current stable npm release
- `beta` means the current beta install target, which may point to either the active prerelease or the latest promoted stable build
- Stable and stable correction releases publish to npm `latest` and also retag npm `beta` to that same non-beta version after promotion, unless `beta` already points at a newer prerelease
- Every OpenClaw release ships the npm package and macOS app together

## Release cadence

- Releases move beta-first
- Stable follows only after the latest beta is validated
- Detailed release procedure, approvals, credentials, and recovery notes are
  maintainer-only

## Release preflight

- Run `pnpm build && pnpm ui:build` before `pnpm release:check` so the expected
  `dist/*` release artifacts and Control UI bundle exist for the pack
  validation step
- Run `pnpm release:check` before every tagged release
- Maintainer release automation now uses preflight-then-promote:
  - real npm publish must pass a successful npm `preflight_run_id`
  - public `macOS Release` is validation-only
  - real private mac publish must pass successful private mac
    `preflight_run_id` and `validate_run_id`
  - the real publish paths promote prepared artifacts instead of rebuilding
    them again
- npm release preflight fails closed unless the tarball includes both
  `dist/control-ui/index.html` and a non-empty `dist/control-ui/assets/` payload
  so we do not ship an empty browser dashboard again
- If the release work touched CI planning, extension timing manifests, or fast
  test matrices, regenerate and review the planner-owned `checks-fast-extensions`
  shard plan via `node scripts/ci-write-manifest-outputs.mjs --workflow ci`
  before approval so release notes do not describe a stale CI layout
